## Bulário
Bulário is an app to help you find if any of your medication is getting you an unwanted effect.

Add medicines you are currently taking  to a medication and generate a log with all the side effects each one can have on you. 
 * Search by name using the `/medicines` GET route get the `numeroRegistro` from the result
 * Save how many you want in a medication using  `/medications` POST route.
 * Generate  the side effects using the route  `/medicines/generate`
 * Wait while we sort things up and use the route `/medications/side-effects` to get the result
